## Flashcard Project

This project contains a React program which stores and displays cards and organized decks of those cards. The cards can be studied, edited, and deleted as the user pleases. Decks can also be manipulated in a similar matter.

# Decks

In this project, decks are organized collections of flashcards. A deck must contain at least 3 flashcards before they can be studied, which is done using the study button on either the home page, or on the deck profile page.

# Cards

Cards consist of a front, a back, a unique card ID, and an identifier that assigns each card to a particular deck. Cards may be edited using the edit button on each deck's profile, and they may also be studied given that a deck has 3 cards within it.
